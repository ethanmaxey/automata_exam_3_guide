# ðŸ¤– Automata Exam 3 Study Guide

ðŸ“š This study guide is intended to help you prepare for your Automata Exam 3. It assumes you have no prior knowledge of automata, and provides the resources each step of the way to learn and solve the types of problem on exam 3. Previous exams are available in the resources section of the discord. 

### Knowledge Needed From Exam 1 & 2:
1. Context-Free Languages
2. GNF

## Question 3

> Construct a pda P that accepts the following language by empty stack: L = L(G) where G = {...} with T = {...}, N = {...}, and P = {...}. State on which side you write the top of the stack, left, or right. Note: You must use the construction "cfg -> pda" given in class. Get G into GNF first!

## Question 4

> Construct a grammar for L(G) for the language N(P): P = {...} where the move function delta is given by {...}. Here, the top of the stack is on the left.
