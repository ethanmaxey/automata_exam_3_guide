## Question 3

> Construct a pda P that accepts the following language by empty stack: L = L(G) where G = {...} with T = {...}, N = {...}, and P = {...}. State on which side you write the top of the stack, left, or right. Note: You must use the construction "cfg -> pda" given in class. Get G into GNF first!
